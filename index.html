        This week we leanred about safety, about the Rube Goldberg machine, Machnical engineering, got introduced to tinkerCad and learned how to use the basics, and made things like our own rube goldberg machine. We also did a challeng to create a home appliance in TinkerCad, i made a microwave.I enjoyed using tinkercad but it was also a challenge.

        All of this week we worked on our real, cardboard rube Goldberg machine. On challege day we had to make a paper boat that can carry the heaviest object for the longest time on water.

        This week we took apart a computer and labeled the components of a computer on a work sheet, then we put the computer back together.

        This week we worked on our bottle rockets and lunched them. Most rockets were simple with a few that werent. ALmost all the rockets went backwards, probaboly due to the areodynamics.

     This week we started our electrical engineering unit. We started by learning the basics like volts, ohms, amps, and current. After we learned that we started to make our own circuts in tinkerCad.

         This week we started making real circuits with arduinos. We made three circuits with our partners and filled out a worksheet by finding the volts and resitance with a multimeter. On challenge day we had to convince Mr. Poole if counting to 1,000,000 is easieir or taking a math class for one year.

         This week we learned about civil engineering is a type of engineering that deals with construction. We were given a project to make a brdige out of Spaghetti that holds the most weight.

        During last semester we completed the speggeti bridge project and tested our bridges. During winter break i mostly stayed home except going out with my friends a couple times a week and some chrismas parties. This week we learned about Buissness engineering to get ready for our buissness presentation.

         This week we got more into the buissness engineering. We started to make our own slide show that resembles shark tank. We were put into groups and me and my partner chose to make a buisness pitch about a teleportation buissness. The whole week was for making the slide show and at the end of the week we presented our buissness.

          This week we learned about chemical angineering and different types of liquids. We made ooblec and learned about the consistincy of it and other types of liquid. At the end of the week we started another project where we had to build a mouse trap car, an arduino car, or solve a problem at our school. Me and my partner chose to make an arduino car

           This week we started to design our arduino car in tinkercad. We made a base based on the size of the actual ardunio and estimated how big it would actually be. We then added four motors and four wheels coresponding with the motors.

           This week we spent all week working on our projects, whicb is the ardunio car. We finished all of the thing ebfore and finally started our build and code. We built our base out of cardboard and looked for more code. we started the code and recived our two wheeles and the two motors.

            This week we started working on our prototype build for our boat. We somewhat based it off our TinkerCad build. We completed our prototype and will be testing it next week. In the next few weeks we will start to build our real boat for our final.
