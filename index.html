        This week we leanred about safety, about the Rube Goldberg machine, Machnical engineering, got introduced to tinkerCad and learned how to use the basics, and made things like our own rube goldberg machine. We also did a challeng to create a home appliance in TinkerCad, i made a microwave.I enjoyed using tinkercad but it was also a challenge.
